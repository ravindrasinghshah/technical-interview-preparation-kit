### Arrays

An array is a data structure used to store multiple elements. Arrays can be single or multi-dimensional (2d).

#### Time complexity of array operations

| Operation            | Method   | Complexity |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Append to end        | push()   | O(1)       |
| Popping from end     | pop()    | O(1)       |
| Insert, not from end | splice() | O(n)       |
| Delete, not from end | splice() | O(n)       |
| Modify an element    | by index | O(1)       |
| Random access        | by index | O(1)       |
| Check if exists      | traverse | O(n)       |
