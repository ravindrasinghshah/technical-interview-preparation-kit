# Strings Overview

### Strings methods

_length_ - returns the length of the string.

```
Example: "interview".length => 9;
```

_substring()_ - returns the substring at the specified location within a String object.

```
Example: "interview".substring(1) => "nterview";
```

### Subsequence

A [subsequence](./Problems/printSubSequence.ts) is a sequence that can be derived from a string by removing some or none of the elements without changing the order of it.
