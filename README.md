## 📅 How to use this repository?

This is your **all-in-one interview preparation notebook** for **system design**, **data structures** and **algorithms** in TypeScript.  
Rather than just reading theory, you’ll **learn by solving real interview-style problems** — organized for maximum efficiency.

## Testing

This repository uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for automated tests. Tests live beside their topic in an `_test_` folder and use the `.test.js` extension.

```text
3-Patterns/
  5-Recursion/
    Problems/
      countdown.ts
    _test_/
      countdown.test.js
```

### Run tests

```bash
# Run the complete test suite once
npm test

# Re-run affected tests while you work
npm run test:watch

# Run one test file
npx vitest run 3-Patterns/5-Recursion/_test_/countdown.test.js
```

### Add a test for a problem method

Export functions or classes from problem files, and do not run example calls when the module is imported. Return a value whenever practical so tests assert results rather than console output.

```ts
// Problems/countdown.ts
export function countdown(n: number): number[] {
  if (n <= 0) return [0];
  return [n, ...countdown(n - 1)];
}
```

Create a matching test file in the topic's `_test_` directory:

```js
// _test_/countdown.test.js
import { countdown } from "../Problems/countdown";

describe("countdown", () => {
  it("returns values from n through zero", () => {
    expect(countdown(3)).toEqual([3, 2, 1, 0]);
  });
});
```

For in-place methods, assert the changed input after calling the method—for example, `expect(values).toEqual([1, 2, 3])` after sorting `values`.

### How to Get Started

1. **Follow the Learning Path**
   - Start with **Basics** to build a solid foundation.
   - Move through **Complexity Analysis**, **Core Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.
   - Progress into **Problem Patterns** and **System Design** for advanced preparation.

2. **Practice with Purpose**
   - Use the **Exercises** folder to code hands-on solutions.
   - Review explanations, analyze time/space complexity and test with provided cases.

3. **Customize Your Notes**
   - Fork the repo and add your own solutions or optimizations.
   - Bookmark tricky problems for quick revision before interviews.

4. **Stay Interview-Ready**
   - Treat this like your **exam revision notes** — structured for quick refreshers when time is short.

### 🆚 How Is This Different from LeetCode or Other Platforms?

While platforms like LeetCode are great for volume practice, this repo is **centralized, curated and customizable**:

- **Time-Saving:** No endless searching — everything you need is here.
- **Easy to Navigate:** Organized by topic, difficulty and problem pattern.
- **Customizable:** Extend it with your own study notes and problem sets.

In short: **Think of it as your personal exam notes — organized, concise and perfect for revisiting right before you step into the interview room.**
